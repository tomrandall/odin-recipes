    <h3>Deliciously crispy air fried chicken</h3>
    <p>Using an air fryer to cook a whole chicken is the way to go. 
     You'll end up with super crispy skin on all sides and even the white meat stays tender and juicy. Don't skip the resting step as this allows the juice to absorb back into the meat.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 (5 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        <li>Whisk olive oil, Italian seasoning, poultry seasoning, paprika, and salt together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Pat chicken dry using paper towels. Brush spice mixture over entire chicken, including underneath the wings.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in the basket of the air fryer breast side down; cook, undisturbed, for 45 minutes. Carefully flip the chicken over using tongs; cook until an instant-read thermometer reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 20 minutes. Remove chicken to a cutting board; let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
     </ol>
